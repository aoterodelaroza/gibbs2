c  break, coef, l, k.....forms the pp-representation of the function  f
c        to be evaluated. specifically, the j-th derivative of  f  is
c        given by
c
c     (d**j)f(x) = coef(j+1,i) + h*(coef(j+2,i) + h*( ... (coef(k-1,i) +

c     the interval index  i , appropriate for  x , is found through a
c  call to  interv . the formula above for the  jderiv-th derivative
c  of  f  is then evaluated (by nested multiplication).
